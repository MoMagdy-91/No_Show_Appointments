## 		UDACITY Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 02: investigating a dataset "no show appointments". 
## Summary
##### In this project I investigate a dataset called no show appointments.
## INTRODUCTION:
###### This dataset collects information from 110k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
###### ● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.  
###### ● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.  
###### ● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.  
###### ● ‘No_show’ it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
